CVS Pharmacy App

Decision: When and how to refill or buy a health item while balancing cost, convenience, and timing.

Signals (5–7):
- Prescription refill due date — [Healthcare]
- Insurance/copay amount — [Payments]
- Stock availability at local CVS — [Logistics]
- Pickup or delivery method — [Logistics]
- Estimated time to readiness (minutes) — [Logistics]
- Digital coupon/ExtraCare discount — [Payments/Promotions]
- Past refill/order history — [CVS]

Gaps: Real-time doctor’s office updates (e.g., renewal sent/approved) often arrive late.

Risk: If [Payments] approves but [Logistics] is out of stock, the user is charged but can’t receive the item immediately.

Stewardship: Prescription data is sensitive; restrict access to patient/pharmacy staff, secure storage, and consented sharing (HIPAA-aligned).

Data Domain: Primary — CVS Pharmacy app; Adjacent — [Payments], [Healthcare/Logistics].
